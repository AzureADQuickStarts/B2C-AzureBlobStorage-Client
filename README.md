# B2C-AzureBlobStorage-Client
A simple program that uploads a directory of files to an Azure Blob Storage Account and enables CORS access for the files.  Used for uploading HTML, CSS, and image files for B2C UI customization.

To run, simply download [`B2CAzureStorageClient.zip`](https://github.com/azureadquickstarts/b2c-azureblobstorage-client/raw/master/B2CAzureStorageClient.zip), unzip it, and run `B2CAzureStorageClient.exe`.

There are a set of CSS examples provided in the `sample_templates` directory that can be used to try out the UI customization features of Azure AD B2C.

The code for the program is in the `B2C-AzureBlobStorage-Client` directory.  It uses the Windows Azure Storage SDK, which is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net).

The tutorial for Azure AD B2C UI Customization is [available on Azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-b2c-reference-ui-customization-helper-tool).
